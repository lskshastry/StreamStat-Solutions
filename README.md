Shared repo for analyzing YouTube data for Cpt_S 415 at WSU

First to run youtube_start.py
Insert zip folders into DataZip
The files will be auto-extracted, cleansed, and parsed...

Next run youtube_mongoDB.py
This will take all files extracted from previous steps, from the DataExtracted folder.

Finished!
At the end of our mongoDB script we upload all changes, you will see a confirmation if it worked in the console.
